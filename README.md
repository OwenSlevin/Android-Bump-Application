# Android-Bump-Application

This is an application that allows users to enter there social media users names to the corresponding social media website. The app will then store the users information using androids SQL abilities. When two devices with the app are within an acceptable range they can press the Bump button and then fist bump there devices together. The backend firebase functions server will then check that the bump was intended to happen and if all the criteria passes the social media usernames from each device will then be transfered to the other device where they can then be accessed later.
